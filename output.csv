identity solutions. Acuant's Trusted Identity Platform is powered by AI and human assisted machine learning to deliver unparalleled results and operational efficiency. Acuant Connect, Ozone and Facial Recognition System (COFRS) combines four product lines to fulfill the need to authenticate an individual against an identity document they present to establish a trusted relationship. 

COFRS is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that provides an extremely robust basis for identity proofing. The products together authenticate the physical and digital information protecting the authenticity and integrity of the document, provide an assessment of the degree of match of the individual to the photo(s) stored on the document, and perform presentation attack detection via liveness assessment of the individual performing the transaction.

- AssureID Connect SaaS authenticates the physical security features of the document
- Ozone eMRTD Authentication SaaS ensures the electronic data is cryptographically intact and digitally bound to a trusted issuing authority
- Once the document has been determined to be authentic and unmodified from its initial issuance, Acuant FaceID Government SaaS performs a facial recognition match of the photo(s)
from the document with the individual presenting the document
- Acuant Passive Liveness SaaS performs presentation attack detection to thwart fraud 

Document authentication is vital part of confirming the identity of an individual. Authenticating a document requires reviewing the physical document for the presence of known security features;features which are specific to each document type and series from a given issuer. The security features that are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known security features for the specific document and its issuer.

Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products. AFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.

Visibility:
AFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.

Insights:
The AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:
- Historical device behavior
- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment
- Behavior of similar devices in other environments
- Common attack techniques
- Information from threat intelligence feeds

Actions:
With these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.

Easy Integration:
AFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.",,fedramp@armis.com,https://www.armis.com/,,No,[''],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-

All vetted and monitored through the rigorous FedRAMP authorization process.  Use it to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency. Cisco SDWAN-G is a cloud-delivered overlay WAN architecture connecting branches to data centers and multicloud environments through a single fabric and single pane of glass. Cisco SDWAN-G helps ensure a predictable user experience for applications optimized for SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS connections. Comprehensive on-premises and cloud-based security protect against cyberthreats while enabling IT teams to accelerate the transition to a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture where and when it is needed.

 

Cisco SDWAN for Government (SDWAN-G) is owned, operated, and supported directly by Cisco for use in government offerings, providing the following capabilities:

 

 - Enhanced Visibility: Extend your network visibility and observability with our core government self-service portal. You'll gain actionable insights to help you transform network operations from reactive to highly proactive model.

 

 - Right Security, Right Place: On-premises or cloud-based security with secure SDWAN-G helps to accelerate the transition to a secure access service edge (SASE) architecture where and when it's needed.

 

 - Operational Simplicity: With a highly visualized interface and intuitive user experience for simplified configuration, management, operation, and monitoring across the Cisco SDWAN-G fabric. The Cisco SDWAN-G solution comes with pre-configured templates to automate and expedite the deployment of most common use cases. Guided step-by-step configuration designed to intelligently expedite onboarding of new devices, and full integration of unified communication, and security into Cisco SDWAN-G.

  

The Cisco SDWAN-G solution is segregated into four planes with four key components: 

 

Manager

 

- In the management plane, the Cisco SDWAN-G Manager is the centralized network management system and represents the user interface of the solution. Network administrators and operators can configure, provision, troubleshoot, and manage the entire overlay network from a simple graphical dashboard.

 

Validator

 

- In the orchestration plane, the Cisco SDWAN-G Validator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge devices and Controllers. The Validator is largely responsible for the provisioning process as well as first-line authentication, control/management information distribution, and facilitating Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal.

 

Controller

 

- In the control plane, the Cisco SDWAN-G Controller is the component responsible for enforcing policies centrally. When branches come online, their routing information is exchanged with the Controller and not directly with other branches. The Controller works with the Validator to authenticate edge devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity among the edge devices.

  

Edge Devices

 

- In the data plane, the Edge devices are responsible for establishing the network fabric and handle the transmission of data traffic. Edge devices come in multiple forms, virtual and physical, and are selected based on the connectivity, throughput, and functional needs of the site.

 

Collectively, the architecture of the Cisco SDWAN-G fabric simplifies IT operations with automated provisioning, unified policies, streamlined management to help ensure rapid updates and resolutions, advanced network functionality, resiliency, and security. From a single pane of glass, Cisco SDWAN-G helps organizations avoid complex configurations and frequent policy changes that lead to uneven user experiences, thereby increasing overall network efficiency and reliability.",SDWAN_G_FedSales@cisco.com,SDWAN_G_FedOps@cisco.com,https://www.cisco.com/go/sdwan,,No,['Network Management'],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Network-Management

The Meraki platform is built with a modern cloud-managed architecture that is able to quickly scale to meet the needs of customers worldwide. ​

We have taken that knowledge and technical sophistication to create a tailored solution for the U.S. Government. Our solution gives government agencies the ability to quickly deploy, scale and manage cloud networks anywhere in the world in an effort to help meet their cloud-first initiatives. Security is a high priority of our solution, which is why we created a separate platform that stores data on U.S. soil and includes FIPS to further protect government telemetry data from device to cloud. ​Meraki will offer certain MS (Switching), MR (Wireless) and MX (Security and SD-WAN) devices as part of the offering.

Thousands of the world's largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks. 

PhishMe enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails. For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their (e.g. banking) credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that real phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future. 

To maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:

- Content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.

- Responsive Delivery allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. 

- Predefined playbooks with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices. 

- PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks - the leading cause of data breaches - through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool, Cofense Reporter, so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.",,federal@cofense.com,https://cofense.com/solutions/industry/federal-government/,,No,"['Cybersecurity & Risk Management', 'Education & Training']",[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Education-Training

Send Subsystem- Accepts files to fax via email or API (the web send uses this API) in a variety of file formats, rasterizes them into a faxable form and faxes them with a variety of configuration options, retry options, and delivery notification options.
Inbound Subsystem- Accepts inbound faxes, converts them to Portable Document Format (PDF) and stores them either temporarily (for later retrieval from integrated systems) or permanently.
Fax Storage Subsystem- Accepts fax media from the send and inbound system for processing, file conversion, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and storage.
Notification Subsystem- Receives events from the Fax Storage system around fax lifecycle events (fax received, fax sent, fax failed, etc.) and triggers an appropriate notification via email      webhook to the appropriate party.
Enterprise API Subsystem- RESTful API system for sending and retrieving faxes (including individual pages of faxes), marking faxes as received and ready for deletion, and receiving send confirmations.
User Portal Subsystem- Web-based system for sending faxes, configuring account information, and reviewing either received faxes or metadata about received faxes (if storage is disabled).
Account Management Subsystem- RESTful API and back-office web application to manage account configuration, manage inventory, and assign available inventory to users.
Usage Subsystem- Receives information about fax usage reporting and makes information available for populating reporting dashboards.",ecfax@cognosante.com,ecfax@cognosante.com,https://cognosante.com/enterprise-cloud-fax,,Yes,[''],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-A-LIGN-Compliance-and-Security-Inc-dba-A-LIGN filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-

CyberArk Identity Standard and Adaptive SSO, Application Gateway The CyberArk Identity App Catalog comes with thousands of application connections by default, but administrators can use a template to add any application to the catalog that is not already there and set up the authentication method through a variety of mechanisms, such as SAML, OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth2, WS-FED, or even user name/password. CyberArk Identity App Gateway enables VPN-less access to legacy on-prem applications. It allows companies to set up a per-application, per-user access to individual legacy applications. CyberArk Identity Standard and Adaptive MFA CyberArk Identity Standard Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) includes methods such as Security Keys, FIDO 2 Passwordless authenticators, Smart Cards, SMS/Email OTPs and Magic Links. These MFA methods are supported for all targets such as Windows Workstations, Servers and Macs, virtual desktops, VPNs, Web Apps, RADIUS Servers, 3rd party IDPs. CyberArk Identity Adaptive MFA allows customers to configure the solutions to consider various static and dynamic contexts such as device, location, network, day, time etc when evaluating access requests and applying authentication policies based on that. CyberArk Identity Standard and Advanced Lifecycle Management Standard Lifecycle Management (LCM) includes pre-integrated application provisioning and deprovisioning, AD sync and licensing for O365, self-service app request and automated approval workflow, app entitlement management, reporting and SIEM integration.

Secure and flexible SaaS management console allows for centralized policy-based and role-based management to ensure automated, robust and differentiated application of policies based on the user’s role. Automatic elevation of known good programs requiring elevation, including those legacy and not-UAC-aware, significantly cuts down on the IT Service Desk requests, while optional automatic access restriction (for example, network connectivity restriction) for unknown applications significantly reduces the area of attack and helps break ransomware kill chain. Out-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution. Another critical capability is blocking credential, key, secret, password, hash, cookie and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise.

Further, it includes our integration hub, which connects to the industry's broadest range of 3rd party tools, system applications, and data sources, orchestrating processes across applications and minimizing your cost of ownership.

Products within The Exterro Platform:
Employee Change Monitor
Employee Change Monitor enables you to proactively take steps to mitigate risk associated with the change in any data field stored in your HR information system and shared with the Exterro Platform. For example, when an employee leaves your organization, a task can be issued to take a snapshot of her email box and backup her files, a system notification can be sent to alert Records Management of the change in employment status, and the employee can automatically be released from any active legal holds.

File Analysis
Exterro File Analysis provides the critical foundation for any Information Governance project by delivering the information you need to achieve your cost and risk reduction efforts. Intuitive and data-rich dashboards in Exterro's File Analysis software display key information about the content stored on your data sources such as network shares and SharePoint servers. Key document properties such as date created, last modified, access rights, metadata, and content type are displayed, providing the critical foundation for all your information governance cost and risk reduction activities. Proactively manage policies that support organizational goals by gaining insight into the content that matters most. Easily identify data that has business or legal value, such as sensitive data (e.g. personally identifiable or health information), files found outside retention guidelines or ESI on legal hold, to make informed business decisions.

Data Mapping
Build and maintain an up-to-date directory that mirrors your evolving data source inventory with Exterro Data Mapping. Identify important ESI repositories, eliminate irrelevant ones, and meet the most rigorous judicial and compliance standards.

Legal Hold
Say goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone litigation hold processes with world-class legal hold software. With Exterro Legal Hold, you can:
- Manage the entire legal hold process - from notifications, to interviews, to reminders, and more - in one place
- Protect and secure data from accidental deletion with the In-Place Preservation module
- Integrate with your HR system, and get notified of employee status changes, to mitigate the risk of spoliation and automate other operational processes with the Employee Change Monitor module
- Quickly identify critical information from custodian data stored in Microsoft Office 365 prior to collection with the Office 365 Explorer module

In-Place Early Case Assessment
Perform early case assessment through a broad set of analytic and predictive intelligence capabilities that enable rapid identification of the most important documents in a dataset prior to collection. Uncover crucial documents and communications prior to 26(f) conferences to support your proportionality and strategic arguments.

Collection and Processing
Perform targeted collections and full e-discovery document review with a ""one-click"" ability to collect only the relevant files that are identified during ECA. Exterro supports the ability to connect to an ever growing list of 30+ on premises and cloud-based data sources, eliminating the need to send requests to multiple stakeholders to perform collections. Exterro is unique in the market by combining processing with collection and offering documents for review almost immediately after the collection process is started, thus saving you time and money while reducing risk associated with manual handoffs and promotions. In addition, our underlying technology has been built with the future in mind, able to easily and quickly process vast amounts of data without impacting performance for your users.

ESI Vault
The most architecturally advanced ESI storage available delivers significant cost savings, risk reduction, and powers productivity through cross-matter work product re-use and analytics. Maximize work product re-use via a real-time, fully integrated ESI vault that enables one-click repurposing of data across matters. Gain insight and optimize operations through cross matter analytics.

Review
Exterro's end-to-end, fully integrated platform ensures the shortest possible time to review from matter inception. Documents can be concurrently collected and processed from multiple data sources and seamlessly moved into review as data becomes available, without delays, handoffs, and complex promotion/staging procedures common in other platforms.

Production
Choose between Native, PDF, and TIFF production outputs depending on the requirements of your matter. Exterro supports industry-standard loadfiles, including Concordance®, Summation®, EDRM XML, and even custom loadfile. Exterro Production automates the entire production process, including imaging, branding, redaction application and loadfile creation into a single step, eliminating technical intervention and time-consuming handoffs.

Legal Project Management
Exterro Project Management is the only purpose-built project management system designed specifically to orchestrate the workflows and activities associated with e-discovery and other legal processes.

GCP is an extensive suite of products from Google-controlled development environments to customer-managed environments (e.g. Google Compute Engine) offering flexibility via fully customizable virtual machines and utilization of other services like: fully-managed databases and data analytics tools, networking services including virtual load balancing and virtual private cloud solutions, access management tools, Cloud project management tools, machine learning capabilities, and developer tools.

Assured Workloads is a GCP feature which turns on specific project configurations per the target compliance regime for customers. Customers are able to set organization policies on their own without the use of Assured Workloads as well. Products discretely integrate with Assured Workloads and enforce the organization policies themselves.

With Leader Evaluation Manager® (LEM), organizations can guarantee that all employees get the same leadership experience, practice the same evidence-based tactics and are held accountable to the same behavioral standards.

Whether it’s showing empathy or providing a clinical intervention, these calls improve patient safety and experiences — and offer an opportunity to receive first-hand feedback from patients. With Patient Call Manager™ (PCM), healthcare organizations can prioritize and connect patients with caregivers to ease transitions from in-person care to home. This fully HIPAA-compliant tool allows healthcare staff to serve as quality touchpoints and ensure quality outcomes along a patient’s continuum of care from pre-visit calls through post-visit.

Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and ""pay for performance"" model that allows them to know exactly what to expect - It’s the technology you need, when you need it.

All infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool ""Zeus"", which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments - Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true ""hybrid"" cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly ""holistic"" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.

The technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.",,christopher.wilson2@peraton.com,https://www.peraton.com/,,No,[''],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-IaaS filter-business-function-

It also ensures that data security policies are enforced to prevent malicious or unintentional data theft (Data Loss Prevention - DLP). A user’s access to an Internet website is secured with URL categorization, File Hashcheck, Antivirus, and Cloud Sandbox. Based on an administrator-defined policy, if a website is isolated, Menlo instantiates a browser on the user’s behalf in the Menlo platform. This remote browser connects to the target website and all the active content from the website is executed in the remote browser rather than on the end user device. Only the safe visuals are sent to the user’s browser--ensuring the user is protected from any web threat. The Menlo Security cloud will auto-scale as demand increases, enabling users to work securely without impact, even in times of high workload volume. Consistent security policy and visibility can be enforced at a cloud location in close proximity to the user, ensuring the highest performance.

GovPoint operates out of geographically dispersed data facilities owned and maintained by MIS Sciences and does not rely on any other provider for its services. GovPoint Cloud Services is based on VMware, allowing for the smooth migration of workloads and reducing system management complexity. All VMware management functions are available from the client management and provisioning console.

Overview of GovPoint services:

• General Purpose Compute is a balance between processors, RAM, and disk. GPC meets over 80% of computing requirements and is ideal for most web and database applications. GPC uses a blend of high I/O disks and SSDs. Users can choose between pre-configured and hardened images or customize processors, disk space, and RAM to meet particular needs.

• High Demand Compute is a robust environment for transaction or workload-intensive applications that must operate flawlessly, regardless of the load. HDC is a high processor and high RAM compute instance coupled with ultra-high-speed flash drives and 10 Gbps network connectivity.

• Special Purpose Compute allows the customer to create your instances from specialty hardware and software and even use your hardware. SPC fills gaps between the standard cloud offerings and dedicated hosting.

• Private FedRAMP Cloud. If your needs require isolation or dedicated resources, the Private FedRAMP Cloud meets those needs. With the Private Cloud, you fully control all resources, including firewalls, networking, computing, and Storage. Your Private Cloud is isolated from all other tenants and users and is part of the GovPoint FedRAMP Infrastructure.

• Relational Database Services is a self-service, cloud-based service allowing customers to set up, provision, and maintain databases quickly. Supported databases are MS SQL Server, MongoDB, and MySQL. For greater granularity, security, and FedRAMP compliance, MIS personnel work with the client in database deployment, maintenance, and security patching. This relieves the client from these tasks and allows them to focus on their business requirements.

• Incident Response Services is a self-service, cloud-based incident response service center that makes it easy for any agency to manage incidents. Once configured by the agency, GCS-IR manages your incidents, creates notifications, and provides all required logs and reports from beginning to end.

• eAlert Notification Service is a cloud-based, high-speed, high-volume email and SMS sending service designed to send notifications and transactional messages. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email and SMS to keep in contact with their customers. Use the GCS eAlert APIs to integrate eAlert directly into your existing applications. You can also integrate the email sending capabilities of GCS eAlert into the software you already use, such as ticketing systems and email clients.

• Messaging Service Platform offers true SMS/MMS messaging for any application need. You can use a web interface or API to send SMS messages and MMS images.

• Calabrio Workforce Engagement Management is the digital foundation of a customer-centric contact center. This suite of tools helps maximize agent performance and boost workforce efficiency by uniting workforce optimization, agent engagement, and business intelligence solutions in the cloud to deliver improved citizen experiences.

• Virtual Desktop Services is a fully managed, secure cloud desktop service. GCS Desktops can be used to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe. GCS Desktops builds off VMware Horizon, Citrix Desktops, and Microsoft Virtual Desktop Services. With GCS Desktops, your users get a fast, responsive desktop that they can access anywhere, anytime, from any supported device.

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user's email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.

The Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with Proofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.

Proofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE's web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",,fedramp@proofpoint.com,http://www.proofpoint.com/,,Yes,[''],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-

Companies are assigned A-F ratings across risk factors including domain name system (DNS) health, internet protocol (IP) reputation, web application security, network security, leaked information, hacker chatter, endpoint security, and patching cadence. This data is provided to customers via the Security Ratings web application.
Customers use the Security Ratings web application to review security ratings and detailed security reports. Users access Security Ratings through a standard web browser and leverage identity federation for authentication. Within the application, users search for companies of interest and review security reports developed by SecurityScorecard. These ratings and reports allow customers to evaluate the cybersecurity risk for companies of interest using data-driven, objective, and continuously evolving metrics that provide visibility into information security control weaknesses as well as potential vulnerabilities throughout the supply chain ecosystem. Users can also create ""portfolios"" to group together companies of interest and easily compare vendors to help make procurement decisions, evaluate acquisition targets, conduct industry benchmarking, and more.
Additional capabilities and data points (collected from publicly available data sources) in the Security Ratings web application include:

The platform applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques with trusted online/offline data intelligence from physical government-issued documents as well as email, phone, address, IP, device, velocity, date of birth, SSN, and the broader internet to verify identities in real time. It is the only solution that analyzes and correlates every facet of an individual’s digital identity to accurately verify individual identities while simultaneously detecting fraudulent ones. The platform has been certified to meet NIST SP 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 2 and has received a trustmark from the Kantara Initiative (https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list/). SocureGov provides several important capabilities listed below:

- Socure Verify searches and correlates data ingested from authoritative sources to return the best-matched identity. 

- Sigma Identity employs a ML model trained to detect the likelihood of third-party identity fraud, risk, and theft. 

- Sigma Synthetic is purpose-built and trained to tackle fake and randomized synthetic patterns to produce highly accurate, real-time, actionable results.

- Email Risk Score predicts the risk of an email and its correlation to an identity considering hundreds of data elements.

- Phone Risk Score predicts the risk of a phone and its correlation to an identity considering hundreds of data elements.

- Address Risk Score predicts the risk of an address and its correlation to an identity considering hundreds of data elements. 

- Device Intelligence predicts risk associated with a device using data attributes such as IP, geolocation, device type, and device software. 

- Predictive Document Verification (DocV) solution digitally verifies the authenticity of thousands of global identity document types from over 180 countries. When combined with a self portrait, it can also verify that the biometric and identification card photos match.  

- Decision Module provides a seamless method to orchestrate the breadth of Socure’s products, enabling a customer to set risk thresholds and help automate decisions to accept, reject, review, resubmit, or refer individuals in an identity verification flow.",sales@socure.com,fedramp-sensitive@socure.com,https://www.socure.com/,HMULLC9YKLC4,Yes,['Cybersecurity & Risk Management'],[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management

Federal agencies looking to modernize their legacy premises-based contact centers now have a choice to migrate at their pace without compromising security.  Building on two decades of innovation and security, T-Metrics’ CCaaS solution is the only single omnichannel contact center in the market that meets both the robust FedRAMP security standards for cloud deployments and the security and interoperability demands of the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certification for premises-based deployments.

Through its flexible architecture, the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center enables agencies to customize cloud deployment models – public cloud (multi-tenant) and/or private cloud (dedicated instance) - to address different constituent requirements.

Strategically designed, TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center capitalizes on cloud architecture to integrate an agency's existing staff with existing customer telephony platforms (e.g., Avaya, Cisco, MS Teams, Zoom, etc.), which minimizes migration and project risk. Agencies can choose cloud, on-premises virtual machine, and/or on-premises physical servers to integrate existing voice services to the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center. This flexibility allows for zero-maintenance for full cloud deployments. Agencies choosing on-premises integration will provision hardware according to their own requirements and procedures. 

The TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center can be scaled to accommodate current and future contact center resource demands and requirements. The ability to obtain agent subscriptions in small or large quantities enables organizations to quickly scale to levels necessary to handle even the most dynamic volume, especially for emergencies or seasonal demand. The contact center distributed architecture ensures a high-available and high-performance system is deployed in the T-Metrics FedRAMP cloud. Resiliency, scalability, and advanced feature access were traditionally available to only the largest contact centers with significant capital investment. Through the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center, these advantages are now available to every customer through flexible monthly subscriptions. 

The cloud-based service offerings provided by the T-Metrics TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center include the following:
- Skills-based and Attribute-based Routing
- Interactive Voice Response
- Microsoft TeamsTM Integration
- Digital Channel Communication
- Customer & Agent Callbacks

ESC GovCloud consolidates advanced threat prevention with traditional Email Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus security to optimize spending, reduce false positives, and enable operational efficiencies through consolidation. ESC GovCloud can be deployed in line to analyze emails and quarantine threats for active protection, or as a passive monitor for 'bcc' type review of each email.

With no hardware or software to install, the ESC GovCloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:

- Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails
- Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes
- Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets
- Detection of advanced malicious URL threats
- The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.

Organizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time. Today's advanced attacks use email as a primary delivery mechanism for malicious content. While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today's traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today's advanced attacks.

ESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization's existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.",,karan.sondhi@trellix.com,https://www.trellix.com/,,No,"['Communication', 'Cybersecurity & Risk Management', 'Data Management', 'Network Management']",[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Hybrid-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management

It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. 

Through the FedConnect portal, Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.

There are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.

On the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Unison Contracting and Grants software applications, where Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.

On the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.

WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010. Built with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. 

As an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size. Many of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.",cmtssales@wingswept.com,fedramp@wingswept.com,https://securecasemanagement.com/,M3RYEADSETP7,Yes,"['Analytics', 'Data Management']",[''],[''], filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Data-Management

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.

ZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. 

TIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)

Zero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. 

Secure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. 

Third-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.

VDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.

Secure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. ZPA for Workloads reduces operational complexity and cost by eliminating the need for virtual DMZs and VPN meshes with least-privileged access-based connectivity across clouds. In addition, because workloads are hidden behind ZPA, they are invisible to the internet and impossible to attack.

Zscaler will also provide our Zero Trust Exchange services at the FedRAMP Moderate level not only for federal agencies and service integrators, but state, local, education, and critical infrastructure as a fully authorized StateRAMP solution.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.

ZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. 

TIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)

Zero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. 

Secure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. 

Third-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.

VDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.

Secure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. ZPA for Workloads reduces operational complexity and cost by eliminating the need for virtual DMZs and VPN meshes with least-privileged access-based connectivity across clouds. In addition, because workloads are hidden behind ZPA, they are invisible to the internet and impossible to attack.
